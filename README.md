# pang-universe

simple pang game with a science fiction theme, created by Carolina Arlone and Ghers Fisman.

use left and right arrows to move the robot, and the spacebar to shoot and destroy the planets.

if you catch one of the hearts falling from the sky, you will receive an extra life (as long as you don't have the initial and maximum of three).
